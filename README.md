# Plant Disease Recognition System ðŸŒ¿ðŸ”¬

This project is an end-to-end deep learning solution for automatic plant disease detection using leaf images. Leveraging a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this system can classify leaves into 38 different categories, ranging from healthy specimens to various crop diseases, with a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.

## Features

- **Detect 38 Classes:** Including specific diseases for Apple, Tomato, Grape, Potato, and more, as well as their healthy states.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Easily upload leaf images and get instant predictions for plant health and disease.
- **Deep Learning Backend:** Trained on a dataset of 87,000+ images with a robust CNN architecture.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves >96% validation accuracy after 10 epochs.
- **Model Export:** Pre-trained model and training history are included for quick deployment and reproducibility.
