# Plant Disease Recognition System ðŸŒ¿ðŸ”¬

This project is an end-to-end deep learning solution for automatic plant disease detection using leaf images. Leveraging a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this system can classify leaves into 38 different categories, ranging from healthy specimens to various crop diseases, with a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.

## Features

- **Detect 38 Classes:** Including specific diseases for Apple, Tomato, Grape, Potato, and more, as well as their healthy states.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Easily upload leaf images and get instant predictions for plant health and disease.
- **Deep Learning Backend:** Trained on a dataset of 87,000+ images with a robust CNN architecture.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves >96% validation accuracy after 10 epochs.
- **Model Export:** Pre-trained model and training history are included for quick deployment and reproducibility.

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd Plants_Health

text

### 2. Install Requirements

Python 3.8+ is recommended.

pip install -r requirements.txt

text

Typical requirements:

streamlit
tensorflow
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
opencv-python

text

### 3. Download Model

Ensure that `trained_model.keras` is present in your working directory.  
If not, youâ€™ll need to train the model (`Train_plant_disease.ipynb`) or download it if provided.

## Usage

### Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run main.py

text

- Open the browser link Streamlit provides.
- Use the sidebar to navigate between **Home**, **About**, and **Disease Recognition**.

## Model Details

- **Input:** Color leaf images, resized to 128x128 pixels.
- **Architecture:** 10-layer CNN with increasing filter depth and dropout for regularization.  
  - Conv2D layers (32 â†’ 64 â†’ 128 â†’ 256 â†’ 512 filters)
  - Dense layer with 1500 neurons before classification
  - Dropout: 25% (after conv), 40% (after dense)
  - Output: 38 neurons (softmax) for multiclass classification
- **Optimizer:** Adam (`lr=0.0001`)
- **Loss:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Performance:**  
  - Training accuracy: ~99%  
  - Validation accuracy: ~96%

## Dataset

- Based on the [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
- ~87,000 images of healthy and diseased leaf samples across 38 categories.
- Split: 80% train, 20% validation, with separate test samples for final inference.
