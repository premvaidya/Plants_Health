readme_content = """# Plant Disease Recognition System ðŸŒ¿ðŸ”¬

An end-to-end deep learning project for automatic plant disease detection using leaf images.  
Built with a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Streamlit web interface.

## Features

- Detects **38 classes** of healthy and diseased plant leaves (Apple, Tomato, Grape, Potato, etc.).
- **Streamlit Web App** for instant predictions from uploaded images.
- Trained on **87,000+ images** with >96% validation accuracy.
- **Pre-trained model included** for quick deployment.
